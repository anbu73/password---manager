The Secure Password Generator in Python is a program designed to create strong and unpredictable passwords to enhance security. It generates passwords using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring high resistance to hacking attempts. The program allows users to specify the password length and complexity level for customization. By utilizing randomization techniques from Pythonâ€™s random module, this tool helps users maintain secure authentication practices for online accounts and sensitive data protection.
